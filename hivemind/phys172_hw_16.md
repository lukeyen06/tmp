2. a sphere of uniform density with mass 30 kg and radius 0.4 m is spinning, making one complete revolution every 0.7 s. The center of mass of the sphere has a speed of 7 m/s.
3. 
A string is wrapped around a disk of mass m = 2.10 kg and radius R = 0.0900 m. Starting from rest, you pull the string with a constant force F = 7.00 N along a nearly frictionless surface. At the instant when the center of the disk has moved a distance x = 0.150 m, your hand has moved a distance of d = 0.310 m.
