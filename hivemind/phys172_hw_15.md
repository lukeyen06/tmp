1. starting from rest, a woman lifts a barbell with a constant force F through a distance h, at which point she is still lifting, and the barbell has acquired a speed v. let $E_{woman}$ stand for the following energy terms associated with the woman: $E_{woman} = E_{chemical \, woman} + K_{woman(moving \, arms \, etc)} + U_{grav \, woman + Earth} + E_{thermal \, woman}$ the change in the kinetic energy of the barbell is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. the general statement of the energy principle is $\Delta E_{sys} = W_{ext}$. we'll consider terms on the left side of the equation (the $E_{sys}$ side, changes in the energy inside the system) and terms on the right side (the $W_{ext}$ side, energy inputs from the surroundings).
	- for the system consisting of the woman, the barbell, and the earth, which of the following terms belong on the left side of the energy equation (the $\Delta E_{sys}$ side)? $\Delta E_{woman}, \frac{1}{2}mv^2, +mgh$
	- for the system consisting of the woman, the barbell, and the earth, which of the following terms belong on the right side of the energy equation (the $W_{ext}$ side)? no terms because the right side is 0
	- for the system consisting of the barbell only, which of the following terms belong on the left side of the energy equation (the $\Delta E_{sys}$ side)? $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	-  for the system consisting of the barbell only, which of the following terms belong on the right side of the energy equation (the $W_{ext}$ side)? $-mgh, Fh$
	- for the system consisting of the barbell and the Earth, which of the following terms belong on the left side of the energy equation (the $\Delta E_{sys}$ side)? $\frac{1}{2}mv^2, mgh$

2. during 4 hours one winter afternoon, when the outside temperature was 10$\degree$C, a house heated by electricity was kept at 21$\degree$C with the expenditure of 48 kwh (killowatt$\cdot$hours) of electric energy
	1. what was the average energy leakage in joules per second (watts) through the walls of the house to the environment (the outside air and ground)? 
		- $P_{avg} = \frac{48 kWh}{4 h} = 12 kW = 12000 W$
	2. the rate at which energy is transferred between two systems due to temperature difference is often proportional to their temperature difference. assuming this to hold in this case, if the house temperature had been kept at 23$\degree$C(73.4$\degree$F), how many kwh of electricity would have been consume?
		- $\Delta T_{original} = 21\degree C - 10\degree C = 11\degree C$
		- $\Delta T_{new} = 23\degree C - 10\degree C = 13\degree C$
		- $\frac{x \, kwh}{40kwh} = \frac{13}{11}$
		- x = 56.727 kwh

4. you are standing at the top of a 39m cliff. you throw a rock in the horizontal direction with speed 18 m/s. if you neglect air resistance , where would you predict it would hit on the flat plain below?
	- second equation of motion: $y = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
	- $39 = \frac{1}{2}(9.8)t^2$
	- $t = 2.8212s$
	- $d = v_x * \Delta t = 18 m/s * 2.8212s = 50.7816 m$
	- our prediction is too large as a result of neglecting air resistance
5. a box with its contents has a total mass of 20kg. it is dropped from a very high building
	1. after reaching terminal speed , what is the magnitude of the air resistance force acting upward on the falling box?
		- at terminal velocity, $F_{air} = F_g = mg = 9.8 m/s^2 * 20kg = 198 N$
	2. the box survived the fall and is returned to the top of the building. more objects are put into the box, and the box with its content now has a total mass of 55kg. the box is dropped, and it reaches a higher terminal speed than before. after reaching terminal speed, what is the magnitude of the air resistance force acting upward on the falling box? (the fact that the heavier object reaches a higher terminal speed shows that the air resistance force increases with increasing speed)
		- at terminal velocity, $F_{air} = F_g = mg = 9.8 m/s^2 * 55kg = 539N$
6. you drop a single coffee filter of mass 1.1 grams from a very tall building, and it takes 47 seconds to reach the ground. in a small fraction of that time the coffee filter reached terminal speed. 
	1. what was the upward force of the air resistance while the coffee filter was falling at terminal speed?
		- at terminal velocity, $F_{air} = F_g = mg = 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.0011kg = 0.01078N$
	2. next you drop a stack of 4 of these coffee filters. what was the upward force of the air resistance while this stack of coffee filter was falling at terminal speed. 
		- at terminal velocity, $F_{air} = F_g = mg = 9.8 m/s^2 * 4 * 0.0011kg = 0.04312N$
	3. again assuming again that the stack reaches terminal speed very quickly, about how long will the stack of coffee filters take to hit the ground
		- $t_{stack} = t_{single} * \sqrt{\frac{m_{single}}{m_{stack}}} = 47s * \sqrt{1/4} = 23.5s$
7. a block of mass $m$ is projected straight upward by a strong spring whose stiffness is $k_s$ when the block is a height $y_1$ above the floor, it is traveling upward at speed $v_1$, and the spring is compressed an amount $s_1$. a short time later the block is at height $y_2$, traveling upward at speed $v_2$, and the spring is compressed an amount $s_2$. in this discussion we'll use the Energy Principle in the form $E_f = E_i + W_{ext}$, where we assume that thermal transfer of energy (microscopic work) $Q$ between the block and the air is negligible. we can ignore the rest energies which don't change, and the kinetic energy of the Earth, which hardly changes.
	1. system: universe (block + spring + Earth). for this system consisting of the block, the spring, and the earth, which of the following equations correctly represents the energy principle in the form $E_f = E_i + W_{ext}$
		- $\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 + mgy_2 + \frac{1}{2} k_ss_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 + mgy_1 + \frac{1}{2}k_ss_1^2$
	2. system: universe (block + spring). for this system consisting of the block and the spring, which of the following equations correctly represents the energy principle in the form $E_f = E_i + W_{ext}$
		- $\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2  + \frac{1}{2} k_ss_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 - mg(y_2 - y_1) + \frac{1}{2}k_ss_1^2$
	3.  system: universe (block). for this system consisting of the block, which of the following equations correctly represents the energy principle in the form $E_f = E_i + W_{ext}$
		- $\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2  = \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 - mg(y_2 - y_1) - \frac{1}{2} k_s(s_2^2 - s_1^2)$
8. a horse whose mass is $M$ gallops at constant speed $v$ up a long hill whose vertical height is h, taking an amount of time $t$ to reach the top. the horse's hooves do not slip on the rocky ground, so the work done by the force of the ground on the hooves is zero(no displacement of the force). when the horse started running, its temperature rose quickly to a point at which from then on, heat transferred from the horse to the air keeps the horse's temperature constant.
	1. first consider the horse as the system of interest. in the initial state the horse is already moving at speed $v$. write out the energy principle $\Delta E_{sys} = W + Q$ for the system of the horse alone. the terms on the left hand side should include only energy changes for the system, while the terms on the right hand side should relate to the surroundings (everything else). which of the following terms are equal to 0?
		- $\Delta (m_{horse}c^2), \Delta E_{thermal \, horse}, \Delta K_{horse}$
	2. which of the following terms should go on the system (left) side ($\Delta E_{sys}$)?
		- $\Delta E_{chemical \, horse}$
	3. which of the following terms should go on the surroundings (right) side?

	4. next consider the universe as the system of interest. write out the energy principle for this system. remember that terms on the left hand side should include all energy changes for the system, while the terms on the right hand side should relate to the surroundings. which of the following terms are equal to 0?
		- $\Delta E_{thermal \, horse}, \Delta K, Q, \Delta(mc^2), W$
	5. which of the following terms should go on the system (left) side?
		- $\Delta E_{thermal \, air}, \Delta E_{chemical}, \Delta U_{grav}$
	6. which of the following terms should go on the surroundings (right) side?
		- 0
9. a coffee filter of mass 1.5 grams dropped from a height of 1m reaches the ground with a speed of 0.6 m/s. how much kinetic energy $K_{air}$ did the air molecules gain from the falling coffee filter? start from the energy principle, and choose as the system the coffee filter, the earth, and the air. 
	- $E_{potential} = mgh = 0.0015 kg * 9.8m/s^2 * 1m = 0.0147J$
	- $K_{coffee \, filter} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(0.0015kg)(0.6 m/s)^2 = $
	- $E_{potential} = K_{coffee \, filter} + K_{air}$
	- $K_{air} = 0.0147J - 0.00045J = 0.01425J$
